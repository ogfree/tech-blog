# Knicks vs Kings: Where to Watch & Complete 2026 Game Preview

So, you’re looking for the Knicks vs Kings game. You want to know the channel, the start time, and a solid take on what’s going to happen. Let’s cut to the chase. The game is set for **Saturday, January 18, 2026, at 8:00 PM ET**. It’s airing nationally on **ABC**, which means you can catch it on most basic cable packages or via a live TV streaming service. If you’ve cut the cord, the best way to stream it live is through **ESPN+** or a service like **Sling TV’s Orange package**, which includes ESPN and ABC for local markets. For a pure, no-ads NBA experience, **NBA League Pass** is the go-to, but check blackout restrictions for your area. The matchup itself is fascinating—a classic East vs. West clash between two teams with completely different trajectories and star power. We’re talking about the gritty, defense-first New York Knicks led by Jalen Brunson and a newly empowered roster, squaring off against the high-octane, offensive juggernaut Sacramento Kings, still orchestrated by De’Aaron Fox and a rejuvenated Domantas Sabonis. This isn’t just another regular-season game; it’s a litmus test for both squads as they jockey for playoff positioning in a crowded 2026 Western Conference.

## The 2026 Context: Why This Game Actually Matters

Forget the old narrative. The Knicks aren’t just a tough out in Madison Square Garden anymore; they’re a legitimate contender. After a busy 2025 offseason, the front office made one critical move: they acquired a true, floor-spacing power forward in **Paolo Banchero** (via a sign-and-trade with Orlando). Pairing Banchero’s versatile scoring with Jalen Brunson’s elite shot creation and Julius Randle’s interior bully-ball has transformed New York’s offense into a top-10 unit. They’re currently sitting at 3rd in the East with a 25-12 record, and their identity is crystal clear: control the glass, force turnovers, and grind you down in the half-court. They rank 2nd in the league in defensive rating and 1st in rebound rate. It’s a throwback style that’s somehow modernized by Brunson’s crafty playmaking.

On the other side, the Kings are still the Kings—flying high, scoring in bunches, and living and dying by their pace. De’Aaron Fox is a blur, and at 27 years old, he’s in his absolute prime. The real story in Sacramento is Domantas Sabonis. He’s not just a double-double machine; he’s the offensive hub. His ability to run the pick-and-roll, hit the short roll, and find shooters is the engine of the league’s 3rd-ranked offense. But the Kings made a key defensive upgrade this past offseason, bringing in veteran wing **Jae’Sean Tate** from Houston to provide some much-needed toughness and perimeter defense. They’re currently 5th in the West, but they’ve struggled against elite defensive teams, posting a losing record against top-10 defenses. This game is their chance to prove they can win a street fight, not just a shootout.

## How to Watch Knicks vs Kings: Your Complete Guide

Finding the right stream shouldn’t be a scavenger hunt. Here’s the straightforward breakdown for the January 18th showdown.

### Traditional TV Broadcast
*   **Channel:** **ABC** (National Broadcast)
*   **Start Time:** **8:00 PM ET / 5:00 PM PT**
*   **Announcers:** Mike Breen (play-by-play), Doris Burke (analyst), and Lisa Salters (sideline) will have the call.

This is a marquee national game, so it’s widely available. If you have an antenna, you can pull in your local ABC affiliate for free. Cable subscribers are covered.

### Live Streaming Options
For those who’ve ditched cable, you have several solid choices, each with its own pros and cons.

**1. Sling TV (Best for Budget-Conscious Fans)**
*   **Package:** **Sling Orange** ($40/month) or **Sling Orange & Blue** ($55/month).
*   **Why it works:** The Orange package includes ESPN, which simulcasts the ABC broadcast. If you’re in a local market with an ABC affiliate, you might get it through Sling’s local channels add-on. The Orange & Blue package gives you more sports channels (like NFL RedZone) if you’re a multi-sport fan.
*   **Pros:** Cheaper than most live TV bundles, easy to cancel.
*   **Cons:** Local channel availability can be spotty depending on your zip code.

**2. Hulu + Live TV (The All-In-One Solution)**
*   **Package:** **Hulu + Live TV** ($77/month, includes ESPN+ and Disney+).
*   **Why it works:** It reliably carries ABC in most markets. Plus, you get the entire ESPN+ library, which includes NBA, UFC, and exclusive content. The bundle is a no-brainer if you already use Disney+ or Hulu for on-demand shows.
*   **Pros:** Excellent channel lineup, seamless integration with ESPN+ and Disney+.
*   **Cons:** Pricier than basic streaming options.

**3. NBA League Pass (For the Hardcore, Nationwide Fan)**
*   **Package:** **NBA League Pass** ($14.99/month or $99.99/year for a single team).
*   **Why it works:** If you live outside the NY or Sacramento broadcast markets, League Pass is your ticket. You get every out-of-market game, no blackouts, with dual broadcast options (home/away feeds) and full-game replays.
*   **Important Caveat:** This game is on ABC, a national broadcast. If you’re in the New York or Sacramento TV market, this game will be blacked out on League Pass. You’ll need a local option (like an antenna or Hulu + Live TV) instead.
*   **Pros:** The best way to watch every single game if you’re a fan of both teams or the league as a whole.
*   **Cons:** Expensive, and blackouts are a real headache for local fans.

**4. FuboTV (The Sports-First Platform)**
*   **Package:** **Pro Plan** ($75/month, includes 160+ channels).
*   **Why it works:** Fubo is built for sports fans. It carries ABC, ESPN, and a massive slate of regional sports networks (RSNs). Its interface is slick, and the cloud DVR is generous (1000 hours).
*   **Pros:** Best-in-class sports coverage, great for fans who follow multiple teams.
*   **Cons:** Can be pricier than competitors, and its focus on sports means fewer entertainment channels.

## Complete Game Preview: Stats, Matchups, and Key Players

This game will be won or lost in the paint and on the glass. Here’s the deep dive.

### Key Player Matchups to Watch

**Jalen Brunson (NYK) vs. De’Aaron Fox (SAC)**
This is the marquee matchup. Two elite, sub-6'5" guards who score at will. Fox is faster, a better finisher at the rim, and a terror in transition. Brunson is stronger, a better post-up player, and more methodical. Look for the Knicks to try and bully Fox on switches, while the Kings will use Fox’s speed to attack Brunson in pick-and-rolls. The winner of this duel likely dictates the game’s tempo.

**Paolo Banchero (NYK) vs. Keegan Murray (SAC)**
Banchero is the new X-factor for New York. At 6'10" with a smooth handle and a reliable three-point shot, he forces opposing bigs out of the paint. Keegan Murray, Sacramento’s versatile forward, is tasked with that defensive assignment. Murray has the length to contest Banchero’s jumpers, but can he handle Banchero’s physicality in the post? This battle will open up the floor for everyone else.

**Domantas Sabonis (SAC) vs. Mitchell Robinson (NYK)**
Sabonis is the Kings’ engine. He’ll look to set screens for Fox, roll to the rim, and find shooters in the corners. Mitchell Robinson is one of the league’s premier rim protectors and rebounders. His job is to stay vertical, avoid foul trouble, and prevent Sabonis from getting easy putbacks. If Robinson can dominate the defensive glass and limit Sabonis’s second-chance points, it severely cramps Sacramento’s offense.

### Statistical Breakdown & Predictions

| Stat | New York Knicks (Projected) | Sacramento Kings (Projected) | Edge |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Offensive Rating** | 115.2 (8th) | 118.5 (3rd) | **Kings** |
| **Defensive Rating** | 108.1 (2nd) | 113.5 (15th) | **Knicks** |
| **Pace** | 98.2 (28th) | 102.1 (2nd) | **Kings** |
| **Rebound Rate** | 53.1% (1st) | 49.5% (18th) | **Knicks** |
| **3P%** | 36.8% (12th) | 38.2% (4th) | **Kings** |

**The Narrative:** This is a classic “immovable object vs. unstoppable force” scenario. The Knicks want to drag you into a half-court wrestling match. The Kings want to turn the game into a track meet. The team that imposes its style will win.

**X-Factor:** **Bench Play.** The Knicks’ bench, led by **Immanuel Quickley** (if he’s still there in 2026) or a new acquisition, will be crucial for maintaining defensive intensity. The Kings’ bench, featuring a microwave scorer like **Malik Monk**, can erase a deficit in minutes. The team that gets a 15+ point contribution from its second unit will have a significant advantage.

### Prediction & Betting Odds (As of January 15, 2026)

*   **Moneyline:** Knicks +120 | Kings -140
*   **Spread:** Kings -3.5
*   **Total Points:** 224.5

**The Pick:** **Knicks +3.5.** While the Kings are the better offensive team, the Knicks’ defensive identity and rebounding prowess travel well. They won’t let Sacramento run wild, and in a grind-it-out fourth quarter, Jalen Brunson’s clutch scoring and the Knicks’ ability to generate second-chance points will be the difference. The Knicks’ defense is built to frustrate high-powered offenses, and they’ve already proven they can win ugly on the road.

**Player Prop to Consider:** **Domantas Sabonis Over 12.5 Rebounds.** The Knicks are the best rebounding team in the league, but Sabonis is a machine. He’ll be crashing the glass relentlessly, and even against Mitchell Robinson, he’s a strong bet to hit the over.

## Action Steps: How to Lock In Your Viewing Plan

1.  **Check Your TV Provider:** If you have cable or satellite, just tune to ABC at 8 PM ET on January 18th.
